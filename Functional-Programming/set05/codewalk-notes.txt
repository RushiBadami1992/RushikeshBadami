C - 15/15

1) No definition for Classname
2) Follow course conventions -> camel case - no spaces
3) Enrollments-to-rosters : generic return statement : should be more specific
4) add-to-roster -> missing parameter in contract
5) Minor indentation issues
6) Wrong name in contract roster=?
7) roster-set=? could have passed a predicate function to generalize, instead of using two functions
8) Tests fail if the order of students are changed
9) Q2 -> could not answer
