Notes:-
1. Wrong template for LOExpr.

3. Could have used the template for convert-expr-to-string function.
4. Why do you call more-general-expr-to-string as a general function? 
5. The contract for more-general-expr-to-string function is wrong.
6. calculate-start-of-word function has a wrong contract.
7. You can use a foldr for travel-list function.
8. get-part-of-string function should have a strategy of general recursion.
