- Could answer questions asked about design decisions

Rishikesh - A
- Correctly answered - Use a filter within a map to ease the deletion of nodes

Notes:-

- world should indicate list of trees and not list of nodes
- node-selected? needs to have a more specific implementation
- Template for node missing function for list of nodes
- find-max-x should indicate that the input is a non-empty list before during a first on the list
- Could have filtered nodes easily from the given list instead of reconstructing the entire list bottom up on deletion
